## SUMMARY:
My program uses the 3np1 function that eventually turns every number into 1, taking various iterations of the function to arrive to 1 depending on the initial number. My main() function loops the 3np1 for a series of values and keeps track of the value and iterations needed. My graphing() function graphs the iterations needed and updates based on the max.
